This Project is called Cocktailpedia. It is an application that will
allow its users to view recipes and required ingredients to make a desired alcoholic drink depending on the input of liquor. You can also view nearby bars if you dont want to make the drink yourself. 

USER STORY: As a party host, I want to find recipes and ingredients
for alcoholic beverages according to what type of alcohol I have, so that I can entertain my guests.
