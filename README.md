## Usage
This application allows for simple keyword searches. One does not need to know the drink name. Searching the drinks will provide with some info on the drink. 
There are several options, either choose from our popular, latest selection or choose a random drink that refreshes when the site is refreshed.  
The site also has a map that allows for a city search. It will display bard and pub locations around the location.
